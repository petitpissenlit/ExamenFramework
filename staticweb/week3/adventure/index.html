                        Finn is a teenaged human. He was roughly five feet ten tall at the show's debut, but sometime
                        between "The Cooler" and "The Pajama War," he underwent a growth spurt and is currently very
                        nearly as tall as Princess Bubblegum. He is missing several teeth due to his habit of biting
                        trees
                        and rocks among other things. Although his eyes typically lack detail and appear as small black
                        dots, they are shown to have color in "The Enchiridion!" while Finn is undergoing Dark
                        Magician's
                        trials. His left eye is green while his right eye is blue, characteristic of the genetic
                        condition
                        heterochromia. However, as stated by lead character designer Andy Ristaino, "That was a special
                        occasion. The heterochromatic effect was a byproduct of him being hypnotized by that guardian
                        dude." He went on to confirm that both of Finn's eyes are blue
